# GeogFile

Hi! This file folder for assessment 2 

I am Yibo Huang, a geographer studies in University of Leeds.

The thesis of this  assessment is about Bacterial Weapon

The location.txt file is the outputs of the model

There are 4 steps to achieve the goals. First, we read the text file. Second, we located where the weapons were. And then we calculated where the bacteria end up. Finally, we output the data as a text file that including all the bacteria location, which reflect the density of bacteria at each point on the map.

I also added the function to make user input the number of bacteria. And a "fliter" has been used in this function to make sure the user will be inputting the "int" type. Also, each user just have 3 chances to input, which just for fun!

Hope you like it!!
